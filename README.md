# RNASeqUtility

This collection of functions may be used to analyse RNA-Seq data of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).

A possible adaption of the functions in this package to a pipeline for small ncRNA analysis can be found in

* /inst/RNASeqAnalysisTemplates/small_ncRNA_analysis

A shiny interface to the pipeline can be found in

* /inst/RNASeqUI

## Workflow
The workflow of the pipeline can be found in the [manuscript](http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/11/21/rna.058834.116.abstract "Link to the RNA publication") published in RNA and is shown here (Supplementary Figure S1 from the manurscript):
