Copy All files in this directory into the directory where the analysis should be performed. 

This file should include at least one 'samplesInfo.csv' file and one folder (or link to folder) that is named 'rawData' including all fastq files to start with. Please see Configuration_ncRNA_Template.R

The organisation of the files is as follows (in running order): 

	-Configuration_ncRNA_Template.R	This file is the first file to be executed, it creates necessary folders and contains the parameters for the following scripts. 

	-MappAssClust_ncRNA_Template.R This file maps assembles and clusters the reads to the genomes specified in Configuration_ncRNA_Template.R

	-Annotate_ncRNA_Template.R This file annotates the mapped/assembled/clustered sequences according to annotations provided in the configuration file. 

	-DiffExp_ncRNA_Template.R (optional) This gives a rough overview of differentially expressed genes with DESeq and edgeR

	-DiffExp_ncRNA_Template.Rmd Generates a html report of the differentially expressed candidates by employing DESeq2. The file can be executed by calling the DiffExp_RmdToHTML_Template.R It may be also executed within R - Best practice: Copy the file DiffExp_ncRNA_Template.Rmd to (rootDir/reports) and then start R: load knitr package and generate html document with knit2html.  
	
	library(knitr)
	knit2html(knit2html(input="DiffExp_ncRNA_Template.Rmd",output="DiffExp_ncRNA_Template_REPORT"))



General one command Execution: 
One may change the 'Template' term in the file names to something meaningful and accordingly has to change the executeRNASeqRScripts file. This file includes all statements needed to run the R scripts. 
It is called e.g. in your bash with: 'bash executeRNASeqRScripts > executeRNASeqRScripts.out'
